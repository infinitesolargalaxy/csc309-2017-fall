<h1>Git Tutorial</h1>

<p>Today we are going to work on Git.</p>

<p>Git is a version control system for tracking changes and coordinating work on
different projects.</p>

<p>Github is a web-based Git hosting service that allows you to store your
repositories online.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to learn how to work with Git and Github and
work on a team project to make a website ! Let's get started !</p>

<h3>Exercise Workflow:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>To get the most out of this tutorial, please form a team that can work in two computers at the same time.</li>

  <li>ONE person in the team should <a href="https://github.com/new">Go to Github and create a new repository</a> for your team. Initialize the repository with .gitignore, README.md, LICENSE files. (What are those files?)</li>

  <li>Add other members of your team to the repository as collaborators. (Find the Settings - Collaborators option in the project menu)</li>

  <li>While your team clones your repository so they can work with it, start by adding <a href="tutorial05-sample.html">this HTML file</a>(Save link as...) to the repo. 

  <li>That HTML contains both the HTML and CSS within it. Organize the work so each person is only working on a certain aspect of this file.</li>

  <li>Each one of you should set up your workspace, and start working on
  your part of the website. Before you do any work in your local workspace, make sure you create a branch to keep your work to yourself until it is ready to merge.</li>

  <li>After you're done with your part of the website, commit and push your code to the repository.  Keep in mind that after you push your changes are still in your branch only.</li>

  <li>In that final stage, ONE of you should integrate the work.  See what your teammates have done (remember to fetch all the latest changes into your local workspace) and make sure to merge each branch that was created into master and push it on the remote repository.</li>

  <li>(Optional) go to your local repo and execute a git branch --all command. Do you see all the branches from other members of your team ? why?</li>

  <li>(Optional) Go ahead and delete the branches. You don't need them anymore.
  (Don't delete your teammates' remote branches before they are finished though !!)</li>
</ol>
