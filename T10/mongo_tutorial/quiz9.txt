    ph_num: customer_phone_number,
    amount: bill_amount
}

1. Say we want to display only the name and address of each customer. Which of the following would you use?

db.collection(\u201cposts\u201d).find({}, {_id: false, name: true, address: true, ph_num: false, amount: false})
db.collection(\u201cposts\u201d).find({}, {_id:false, name: true, address: true}) ->
None of the above
2. If we want to print out the total spending of each user using Map-Reduce, with the map function defined as


    function() {
        emit(A, B);
        }
      

What is (A, B)?
(name, amount)
(_id, amount)
(this.name, Array.sum(this.amount))
(this.name, this.amount) ->
3. Now we want to specify the list of items bought by the customer in each purchase. Each item has an item_code and a price. What kind of a relationship would this be between \u2018purchase\u2019 and \u2018item\u2019?
