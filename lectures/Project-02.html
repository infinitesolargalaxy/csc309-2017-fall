<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
<h2>The Front-end</h2>

<p>In this assignment, you are responsible for building a front-end for your web application. You will build on top of your first assignment, and present the data retrieved from the API(s) you have found.  </p>

<p>The assignment sits here: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/jZjBSSlY">https://classroom.github.com/g/jZjBSSlY.</a> </p>

<h3>Specifications:</h3>
<p>Given that every group is using different API(s) and has a different end-product in mind, you are responsible for defining a reasonable scope for your web-application. Here are a few standard guidelines that you are expected to adhere to:</p>

<ul>
<li>The application should be a one-page responsive, web application with at least three distinct views that a user can navigate through. </li>
<li>Most user interactions will be handled on the front-end and resolved by javascript running in the browser.  While you are allowed to send requests to 3rd-party API servers, you are not allowed to implement functionality in your own server.</li>
<li>The submission of this assignment should include most of the (front-end) features you intend on demoing for your final project. (Assignment 3 will mostly focus on building a back-end for your application).</li>
<li>The file index.html will be the entry-point for the TAs marking your project. They will open that file from their local machine and expect everything to work.  No server-side code will be tested/launched during the evaluation process.</li>
<li>Include a Solutions.md explaining the features of your web application, the end-user and how s/he might use it.</li>
<li>You are expected to work in the same teams as Assignment 1, unless a TA contacted you with a change of teams.</li>
<li>The deadline for this assignment is Nov 4, 2017. The last commit before 2:00 PM on that date will be used for marking the assignment. If you plan on submitting the assignment late (refer course information for more details), you should include that in your Solutions.md.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan on deviating from these guidelines, talk to the prof or a TA and include an Instructions.md explaining your decision.</p>

<h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will (probably) be using jQuery/AJAX to talk to your API, display/manipulate your data and make it interactive for a user.  Be mindful that interacting with 3rd party APIs leads to some security concerns which some APIs may not support.  </li>
<li>You are not required to use a web framework like AngularJS or a library like React. However, you have the freedom to use what you want to build your user interfaces as long as you abide to the specifications above.  </li>
<li>You will be marked on the functionality of your application, its style and usability, its responsiveness, code quality and structure, and how well the application serves your end-user.</li>
</ul>
